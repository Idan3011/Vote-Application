# Food Election System

This project implements a food election system allowing users to vote for their favorite food among four choices: Hamburger, Pizza, Taco, and Steak. It includes a landing page with a secure login system and a dedicated voting page for users to cast their votes. An admin page grants administrators access to view users' votes, offering insights into the community's preferences.

### Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system boasts an intuitive interface for smooth navigation and hassle-free voting.
- **Secure Login:** Implemented a robust login system to ensure user data security.
- **Vote Casting:** Users can choose from the four food options and cast their votes.
- **Admin Panel:** Admins gain access to a dedicated page displaying users' voting data.

### Technical Implementations
The project utilizes React.js for the frontend, Axios for API calls, and implements user data management with localStorage. User authentication and data storage have been structured to provide a seamless experience. However, challenges were faced in ensuring consistent data rendering and handling different user sessions.

### Challenges Faced
- **Data Consistency:** Maintaining accurate and consistent vote counts across multiple user sessions posed a challenge.
- **Rendering Complexities:** Ensuring real-time updates and data synchronization without compromising user experience required careful handling.

This project aimed to create an accessible and reliable food election system while addressing various technical complexities.
